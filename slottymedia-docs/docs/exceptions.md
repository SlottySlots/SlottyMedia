# Exception Handling in Our Project

To handle exceptions in our project without returning null or an error message in each method, and to enable quick and easy error logging, we need to create our own exceptions. These custom exceptions allow us to pass messages and general exceptions to the next higher class without major issues.

## Benefits of Custom Exceptions

1. **Clarity and Maintainability**: Custom exceptions provide clear and specific error messages, making the code easier to maintain and understand.
2. **Centralized Error Handling**: By funneling errors through custom exceptions, we can handle them in a centralized manner, improving consistency.
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Custom exceptions can include additional context and information, making it easier to log and debug issues.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Creating Custom Exceptions

Define custom exceptions that extend from the base `Exception` class. Custom exceptions should have constructors that allow for detailed error messages and optionally, the inclusion of inner exceptions.

### Throwing Custom Exceptions

Throw custom exceptions where errors are detected. Ensure that error conditions are checked, and custom exceptions are thrown with appropriate messages that describe the error context.

### Handling Custom Exceptions

Catch and handle exceptions at appropriate levels in the application, typically in the ViewModel. Ensure that exceptions are caught, logged, and the error messages are forwarded to the View in a user-friendly manner.

## Important Considerations

- **Error Handling in ViewModel**: Errors should be caught at the latest in the ViewModel and then the message should be forwarded to the View. Try-catch blocks should not be implemented directly in the View to maintain separation of concerns.
- **Logging**: Ensure all exceptions are logged appropriately to facilitate debugging and monitoring.
