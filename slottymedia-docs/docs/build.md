# Contribute & Build 

## How do I contribute as a developer?
<p style="color: red;"><b>READ THIS GUIDE BEFORE CONTRIBUTING</b></p>

Since our project is secured by some pre-commit hooks you have to configure the project correctly before contributing.

This is done as followed:

Clone the project

```git clone https://github.com/SlottySlots/SlottyMedia.git```

Make sure you have installed the following packages globally.

- Gitleaks: https://gitleaks.io/ -> Make sure it's properly installed by typing gitleaks in your terminal
- Node Package Manager: https://www.npmjs.com/

After you've cloned the repo make sure to install all needed packages for the hooks via:

```npm i```

Now it should be configured ðŸš€
